# Weird_Pokemon_Game_from_Scrtach
A Pokemon Game, Build From Scratch
This project is a complicated one, so be sure to keep up
Every Pokemon Game Has basically the same attributes:
items (potions, pokeballs, Berrys and key Items)
Pokemon (Types, Levels, and effects)
And more importantly, Battles.
The Story and the actual game is not important in this project, 
the main goal is to build all the classes and functions as if they were for one of the games
